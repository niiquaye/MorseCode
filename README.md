# MorseCode
Morse Code API - 
a library created in C++ that converts text to Morse code. A hash map was used to link each character
to the corresponding string of dashses and periods in Morse Code. In the class constructor the hash map 
is initialized. The hash map provides constant time look up - O(1). Furthermore, the 'getMorseCode()' returns
the converted text to Morse code which can then be used in other parts in your desired application. In the repository
MorseCode.cpp and MorseCode.h are available for download.
